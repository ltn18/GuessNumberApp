# Guess Number App

## Description
Guess Number App is an interactive game for kids made with React Native. This game is used to teach kids to compare numbers that are higher or lower than the designated value. With simple and friendly UI, I believe that this game is both enjoyable for kids and their parents as it will create memorable educative moments.
